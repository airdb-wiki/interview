[Top 20 Programming questions asked in an interview](https://content.techgig.com/top-20-programming-questions-asked-in-an-interview/articleshow/74608663.cms)

Programming questions are integral part of an interview for the developer's position. No matter which programming language you master, it is expected that you are familiar with fundamental concepts of programming.

Coding interviews mainly comprise of data structure and algorithm related questions along with logical questions. Coding interview questions are related to array, linked list, string, binary tree, and questions from algorithms. Here are 20 most commonly asked interview questions. You can easily find answers to these questions on Google to prepare yourself for the interview.
