问题1：
Nestle is a quite famous company. Why do you choose to leave?
点评：原来的公司不错，为什么要离开。这是在探询你是否有什么特殊的原因。
Two reasons. One is rather personal. I wish to spend more time with my family. But the fact is that I work in Beijing and my family all live here. That’s why I want to leave. And the second reason is that I felt dissatisfaction with the company’s management.
两个原因：个人原因是我想多花时间陪伴家人。现实是，我在北京工作，家人都住在这里。第二个原因我对公司的管理感到不满。
[如果工作和家人都在北京]

我希望能够更多的陪伴我的家庭。但是我的公司距离我家20公里，需要3个小时的路程。另外，我希望能够更多的时间放在工作本身上而非上下班的交通上。
[公司有怎样的管理问题]
I often suffer from waste of time and energy because the office politics in my last job, so I chose to leave and I wish I could contribute more energy and time to my job.
这就是说你讨厌原来公司的办公室政治，导致了时间和精力的浪费，你希望将更多时间和精力放在工作上。

具体的一些可以说的上一份工作而不会遭到猜忌的一些语言：
1)Since my team is understaffed , my workload is much heavier than others. But my salary remained the same. I was not treated equivalently with other employees.
由于我所在的团队人手不够，我的工作量比他人更重，但是我的工资却没有上升。
2)I felt that the communication between our boss and us was not enough. I rarely saw my boss coming into our office and talk with us.
我觉得自己没有受到同等对待，此外我认为上司和我们之间的沟通不足，很少看见上司走出办公室和我们交谈。
3)no recognition was given to me.
我得不到认可
一些问题的回答：
1）why do you choose to leave?
I am not satisfied with my salary.
我对工资不满意：你是一个看重金钱的人，那么你会之后因为更高的工资跳槽到其他公司。
2）I am too tired because of heavy workload.
我工作量太大，我感到疲劳：会觉得你是一个偷懒的人。

问题2：What were the biggest challenges in your last job?
The work always seemed to come in spurts. When it was busy, we had to work especially hard to stay caught up. I can remember some weeks when we never seemed to leave the office. It was hard, but we did whatever it took to get the job done.
工作总是来得十分紧张。忙的时候我们要熬夜完成。在一些星期中，我们好想就没有离开过办公室。虽然很难，我们总是能够想尽一切办法把工作做完。

问题3：how did you get along with your last boss?
My last manager had a very hands-off approach. That was a little scary at times, but it taught me that I can solve problems without a lot of supervision. I was always glad to get guidance, but when it didn’t come, I learned that I can figure out things for myself.
上一份工作我的上司是个“撒手掌柜”。这有时候有点令人恐惧，但是这也教会了我在没有监督和支持的情况下很好的解决问题。我永远愿意得到指导，但是如果没有的话，我也会努力依靠自己的能力解决好面临的问题。
