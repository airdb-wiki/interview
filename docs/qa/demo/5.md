# 第6课 英语面试介绍优缺点

面试拿offer：介绍优缺点
1.优点怎么说
What are your strengths?
回答1：
I wish to put emphasis on three strengths which , in my view, are the most important qualities to achieve success. Firstly, I have good time management skills. Secondly, I do my job whole-heartedly to achieve better results. Many people call me a workaholic. Thirdly, I am a planner. I like to put things in order of priority which makes me more efficient.
我希望着重讲一下三个优点，这些优点是我心目中获得成功最重要的素质。首先，我能够合理安排时间。第二，为了能够更好地完成工作，我会全身心的投入，很多人说我是工作狂。第三，我有合理规划的能力，我喜欢将事情按照轻重缓急规划好，这让我更有效率。
用法：put emphasis on 强调
回答2：
In my opinion, my strongest asset is my ability to stick to things to get them done. I could feel a real sense of accomplishment when I finish a job and it turns out just as I'd expected. In school, I would set goals for every semester. For example, I want to graduate with highest distinction. Though I had a slow start in my freshman year, I managed to catch up with others and was named as the outstanding graduates in my school.
在我看来，我最大的优点是执着，能够尽力将一件事情办好。当我看到工作完成，并且呈现出来的成果与我预期相符合，我就会产生一种真实的成就感。每个学期我会给自己定目标，然后努力完成。例如我曾立志成为出色的毕业生。虽然在大一起步慢了些，但是经过努力，成功的赶上了大家的脚步，成为了我优秀的毕业生。

2.缺点怎么说？
问题1：you didn't write down any disadvantages on your resume? Do you mean that you are perfect?
I should apologize for this to all the interviewers here. I am not a perfect person. Yet I will always pursue to be perfect. I sometimes set unrealistic goals. But the truth is that I can't resist doing so because I need to be motivated by aiming high and I will strive to achieve my goals.
我需要为这一点向所有面试官道歉。我不是一个完美的人，但是我会一直追求完美。有时候我的目标显得不切实际，可事实上，我就是喜欢设定高目标，这样我会更有动力，而且我也会努力完成自己的目标。



问题2：What is your weakness/biggest shortcoming?
回答1：My weakness is that sometimes I talk too much and I am eager to express my opinions. I've noticed that I don't listen enough because of this weakness. So I write down a reminder on my notebook, "listen more, speak less." To some extent, I've overcome this weakness now and paid more attention to others' suggestions and opinions.
我的缺点就是有时候话太多，并且急于表达自己的观点。我的确注意到，由于自己说的太多，有时候会忽略听别人的意见。所以，我在笔记本上写了一句话，少说多听！ 从某种程度上，我已经克服了这一缺点，更加重视他人的意见和建议。
回答2：I am not a great public speaker. When speaking in public I feel uncomfortable unless the topic is familiar. So I have to be well prepared before giving a presentation. Sometimes I cannot fully express myself which leads to misunderstandings and problems. I do admire those who can talk about anything at anytime.
我的公开演讲能力比较差，在公共场合讲话的时候我会感到紧张不安，不过谈论我比较熟悉的领域我比较放松。所以当我需要做公开发言的时候，我必须准备的很充分。有时候因为表达能力不足，会产生误解和其他问题。我确实羡慕那些无论什么话题都能高谈阔论的人。

建议背诵：
To some extent, I've overcome this weakness now and paid more attention to others' suggestions and opinions.
从某种程度上来说，我已经克服了这一缺点，更加重视他人的意见建议。
Since then, I've always attached great importance to details and I didn't make similar mistakes again.
自那之后，我一直十分注重细节而且再也没有犯过类似的错误。
