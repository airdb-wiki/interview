# 第12课 外企HR招聘工作典型对话

I need a good replacement. I don't want to give Craig more work.
Here are more resumes and cover letters for you. They were faxed in over the weekend.
Good. And we should get more today.
Any decent candidates?
Not yet. I want someone experienced in our industry.
Remember, it's a company policy to interview every qualified applicant.



We only have a few. That shouldn't be a problem.
Here are the responses we received via email from our Internet ads on Saturday.
There must be thirty!
Forty-three, actually.
I'd better get on the phone and start setting up interviews.
Remember, interview every qualified applicant.
Oh, and there are responses from Sunday—another sixty. Internet job ads sure are effective!
One hundred resumes? I'll be here all day, and I'll be interviewing for a month.
Anything to keep from giving me extra work, right?
Wrong! Here. Screen these hundred applications for me by the end of the day!
